## Project Overview

For this project, the dataset used is the <a href="https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130+us+hospitals+for+years+1999+2008">UCI dataset</a>. The dataset (diabetic_data.csv) represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.

The dataset contains 50 explanatory variables that describe the patient and hospital outcomes. We predict the readmission of a patient discharged from a hospital within 30 days, based on the given dataset. The data is preprocessed, split into a train and test data set for training and testing purposes. The training and test set have been taken from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ap_ONx3lm2MyHJVlex2jypLi05mhh-xm?usp=sharing">this folder.
  
### Goal:
The primary objective of this project's predictive analysis is to build a binary classification model that can predict early (<30 days) readmission given the patientâ€™s features i.e. - <b>To predict whether a patient will be readmitted in hospital given that they have been discharged from the hospital in the last 30 days.</b>
